# Qur’an Page Marker

*A precise and elegant tool for segmenting Qur’anic audio by page — built for students, memorizers, and developers.*

---

## 🌟 What is this project?

**Qur’an Page Marker** is a free and open-source web tool designed to help users mark the **end time of each page** in a Qur’anic recitation audio file (e.g. MP3). It features:

- 🎧 An intuitive Arabic interface
- ⏱ Millisecond-accurate audio control
- 📊 Timeline visualisation
- 💾 Automatic save/load from browser memory
- 📄 CSV export ready for audio splitting tools (Bash, Go, etc.)

This tool solves a meaningful challenge for **Qur’an learners and memorizers (ḥuffāẓ)**. Many students listen to a preferred reciter and repeat 1–2 pages daily for revision or memorisation. By segmenting audio page-by-page, this tool enables:

🔊 **Qur’an-per-page distribution** for any reciter — a powerful step towards supporting personalised memorisation journeys.

> _In shā’ Allāh, this project will help Ahl al-Qur’an memorise more easily, clearly, and consistently with their favourite reciter._
